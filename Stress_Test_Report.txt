INITIATING THEORY DESTRUCTION TESTS...

TEST 1: ISOBAR BLINDNESS (The Weak Force Attack)
Hypothesis: Geometry based solely on 'A' cannot distinguish Proton from Neutron.
If the theory assigns equal efficiency to stable and unstable isobars, it fails.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ISOTOPE  | STATUS     | EFFICIENCY (Alpha)   | RESULT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--- GROUP A=40 ---
Ar-40    | STABLE     | 1.115317 alpha
K-40     | UNSTABLE   | 1.109824 alpha
Ca-40    | STABLE     | 1.114610 alpha
 > Resolution Power (Delta Eff): 0.005139
 > [PASS] Theory detects geometric difference.

--- GROUP A=50 ---
Ti-50    | STABLE     | 1.137596 alpha
V-50     | UNSTABLE   | 1.131155 alpha
Cr-50    | STABLE     | 1.134186 alpha
 > Resolution Power (Delta Eff): 0.004736
 > [PASS] Theory detects geometric difference.

--- GROUP A=87 ---
Rb-87    | UNSTABLE   | 1.129396 alpha
Sr-87    | STABLE     | 1.129870 alpha
 > Resolution Power (Delta Eff): 0.000474
 > [CRITICAL FAIL] Theory is 'blind' to Beta Decay.
   It cannot explain why Sr-87 decays into its neighbor.


TEST 2: LATTICE SATURATION (The Statistical Attack)
Hypothesis: At high energies, the geometric lattice is so dense anything fits.
Method: Generate 1000 RANDOM 'particles' (2000 - 10000 MeV) and measure hit rate.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Number of geometric nodes in 2-10 GeV band: 199
Success rate of RANDOM numbers (Noise Floor):  99.80 %
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERDICT:
[DANGER] Lattice is saturated!
More than 20% of random numbers hit the theory. Prediction power >2 GeV is low.
